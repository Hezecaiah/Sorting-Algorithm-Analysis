# Sorting-Algortithm-Analysis
This set of java classes contains implementations of 5 different sortings algorithms which then run the same 5 integer arrays
(generated randomly in the case of target1, target2 and targetBig and constructed in the cases of target3 and target4) to demonstrate
that they work properly, as well  as providing the number of iterations (steps taken to analyse each element of array) and operations
(number of actual integer swaps necessary to sort each array.) For cohesiveness of narrative, please read the classes in the following
order: bubble, insertion, selection, quick, and finally merge.
