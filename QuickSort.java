	/*
	 *	Quick sort is the first algorithm in this analysis which utilizes the divide and conquer method of
	 *sorting values by pivoting an array around a given value, sorting the values into arrays on either side,
	 *and repeating. The worst case complexity is still O(n^2) but the advantage of the sort is that the average
	 *complexity is Î˜(n log(n)). This average runtime is calculated by considering every possible 
	 *permutation of array which is far too exhaustive for this particular research but the average runtime is 
	 *generally accepted as thus by those who have the time to do so. This average runtime is what makes the
	 *algorithm useful as the average real world case occurs much more frequently and the algorithm can be altered
	 *to suit the specific real world data.
	 * 
	 *Footnote: The "iterations" in this example are technically recursions, but for the sake of parity with the
	 *rest of the analysis and as that the principle that the iterations counter tracks is functionally the same,
	 *the convention remains.
